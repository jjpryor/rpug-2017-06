## Puppet 5 pre-release announcement
[In the 2nd half of blog piece](https://puppet.com/blog/full-visibility-and-control-of-your-infrastructure-new-puppet-releases) they detail the following:
+ *Each of the three main packages that make up the platform — puppet-agent, puppet-server, and puppetdb — are all trued up to version 5.0.0, and they're available from a repository called puppet5.*
+ *The release cadence and versioning of these components will align around monthly, semver-compliant releases, and each set of releases will be tested together and guaranteed to interoperate.*
+ *As we move towards the next major version of the platform, all three components will embody the Puppet 6 Platform together, and will be released into a puppet6 repository, which you can opt into when you're ready.*
+ *Despite the major version number, the prime directive of Puppet 5 is this:* **Modules that work on Puppet 4 will work unchanged under Puppet 5.**

+ [There are new builds in the 'puppet5-nightly' repos.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/puppet-dev/tlQYSHBDQAQ)
